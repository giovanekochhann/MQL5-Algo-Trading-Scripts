TradeLevels Script

After long time observing the markets I realized that the price moves inside channels.

Using MetaTrader5 I draw and update manually the main channels and the 50% channel mark.

Now i have written this script, it requires the base price and channel size (this comes from my analysis).

And it Draws 6 channels and their intermediate 50% lines.

This is how the lines looks like. It is simple and very useful for my trading.
